\usage{
acc_ipb(
  data,
  test,
  disease,
  covariate = NULL,
  option = 1,
  interaction = FALSE,
  ci = FALSE,
  ci_level = 0.95,
  ci_perc = FALSE,
  b = 1000,
  seednum = NULL,
  return_data = FALSE,
  return_detail = FALSE,
  description = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, with at least "Test" and "Disease" variables.}

\item{test}{The "Test" variable name, i.e. the test result. The variable must be in binary; positive = 1, negative = 0 format.}

\item{disease}{The "Disease" variable name, i.e. the true disease status. The variable must be in binary; positive = 1, negative = 0 format.}

\item{covariate}{The name(s) of covariate(s), i.e. other variables associated with either test or disease status.
Specify as name vector, e.g. c("X1", "X2") for two or more variables. The variables must be in formats acceptable to GLM.}

\item{option}{1 = IPW weight, 2 = W_h weight, described in Arifin (2023), modified weight of Krautenbacher (2017).
The default is \code{option = 1}. For small weights, \code{option = 2} is more stable (Arifin, 2023).}

\item{interaction}{Allow interaction terms between covariates in propensity score calculation.
The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ci}{View confidence interval (CI). The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ci_level}{Set the CI width. The default is 0.95 i.e. 95\% CI.}

\item{b}{The number of bootstrap samples, b.}

\item{seednum}{Set the seed number for the bootstrapped CI. The default is not set, so it depends on the user
to set it outside or inside the function.}

\item{return_data}{Return data for the bootstrapped samples.}

\item{return_detail}{Return accuracy measures for each of the bootstrapped samples.}

\item{description}{Print the name of this analysis. The default is \code{TRUE}. This can be turned off for repeated analysis, for example in bootstrapped results.}

\item{ci_percentile}{Calculate CI by percentile method. The default is normal distribution method (\code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A list object containing:
\describe{
  \item{acc_results}{The accuracy results.}

}
\description{

\examples{
# no covariate
acc_ipb(data = cad_pvb, test = "T", disease = "D", b = 1000, seednum = 12345)

# with three covariates
acc_ipb(data = cad_pvb, test = "T", disease = "D", covariate = c("X1","X2","X3"),
        b = 1000, seednum = 12345)
