Description: The package contains a number of functions to perform partial verification bias 
    (PVB) correction for estimates of accuracy measures in diagnostic accuracy studies. 
    The available methods are: Begg and Greenes' method (as extended by Alonzo & Pepe, 2005),
    Begg and Greenes' method 1 and 2 (with PPV and NPV as extended by deGroot et al, 2011),
    multiple imputation method by logistic regression (Harel & Zhou, 2006),
    and EM-based logistic regression method (Kosinski & Barnhart, 2003).
